## üî¥ Critical Issues

### 1. Typo in Sign-In Route Folder Name
**Location:** `app/(auth)/sign-in/[[...sigin-in]]/page.tsx`  
**Issue:** The folder is named `[[...sigin-in]]` instead of `[[...sign-in]]`  
**Impact:** This is a typo in the dynamic catch-all route folder name. While it may work, it's inconsistent with standard naming conventions.  
**Fix:** Rename folder from `[[...sigin-in]]` to `[[...sign-in]]`  
**Severity:** Medium - Functional but inconsistent

### 2. Function Name Typo
**Location:** `app/(auth)/sign-in/[[...sigin-in]]/page.tsx` (line 3)  
**Issue:** Function is named `SiginInPage` instead of `SignInPage`  
**Impact:** Naming inconsistency, harder to maintain  
**Fix:** Rename function to `SignInPage`  
**Severity:** Low - Functional but poor naming

### 3. Inconsistent Environment Variable Documentation
**Location:** 
- `app/api/create-cashfree-order/route.ts` (lines 29-30)
- `app/api/check-payment-status/route.ts`
- Documentation files (SETUP.md, README.md, DEPLOYMENT.md)

**Issue:** The code uses `CASHFREE_API_KEY` and `CASHFREE_SECRET_KEY`, but documentation refers to `NEXT_PUBLIC_CASHFREE_APP_ID` and `CASHFREE_SECRET_KEY`. The variable names are inconsistent between code and documentation.
**Impact:** Configuration errors, developers may set wrong environment variables  
**Fix:** Standardize variable names across codebase and documentation  
**Severity:** High - Can cause runtime errors

**Impact:** Unnecessary imports, slightly larger bundle size  
**Fix:** Remove `import React from 'react';` statements  
**Severity:** Low - Minor optimization

### 6. Missing Error Handling
**Location:** `components/AdminPanel.tsx` (line 37-40)
**Issue:** Using `throw new Error()` in a component can crash the entire app instead of graceful error handling  
**Impact:** Poor user experience, app crashes  
**Fix:** Implement proper error boundaries or return null with error logging  
**Severity:** Medium - Can crash app
